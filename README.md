# 👋 Hi, I'm Falah

Welcome to my GitHub profile — and welcome to the beginning of my web development journey.

I'm just getting started, learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** step by step.  
Right now, I am focused on building a strong foundation and creating real projects as I learn.

---

## 🌱 Current Stage — **Stage 1: HTML Basics (Completed)**

I have:
- Learned the fundamentals of HTML  
- Built my **first static webpage**  
- Created practice files (lists, forms, tables, images, links, semantic tags)  
- Organized everything into a clean learning repository  

🔗 **View my Stage 1 repository:**  
https://github.com/falah-tech/stage-1-html-basics

🔗 **Live Page (My first HTML project):**  
https://falah-tech.github.io/stage-1-html-basics/

This is just the starting point — more to come.

## 🚀 Next Goal — **Stage 2: HTML + CSS Projects**

Coming soon:
- Profile Card UI  
- Hero Section  
- A custom HTML + CSS project  
- Better design and structure  
- More professional project layouts  

I will continue updating this profile as I learn and grow.

## 📘 Long-Term Learning Roadmap

I plan to learn and build projects in the following order:

1. **HTML** ✔️  
2. **CSS** (Next)  
3. **JavaScript Basics**  
4. **JavaScript Projects**  
5. **React.js**  
6. **Personal Portfolio Website**  
7. **API-based and full-stack projects**

This GitHub will be my progress tracker.

## 🧱 Brick by Brick

I believe in building slowly and consistently:  
**One concept → One mini project → One stage at a time.**

This profile may look simple now, but it will grow — just like my skills.

Thanks for visiting.  
Stay tuned — the journey has just begun. 🚀
